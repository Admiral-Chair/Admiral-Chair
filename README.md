Iâ€™m @Admiral-Chair from Reddit (u/Sir_Admiral_Chair), I am making a tutorial for people who struggle to put their phone down, either because they have ADHD, sleeping issues, 
or even an internet addition or all three. ðŸ‘€

I could make other things in the future idk, I just do things that catch my interest.

If you wish to contact me, pm me on my Reddit.

You can steal this cute picture of a Koala I took myself at the Australia Zoo in Sydney. :)
